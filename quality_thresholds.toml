# Quality Thresholds Configuration
#
# This file defines configurable thresholds for quality diagnostics in
# GlobtimPostProcessing (Issue #7, Phase 3).
#
# These thresholds replace hardcoded "made up" values with explicit,
# documented, and adjustable quality criteria.

[l2_norm_thresholds]
# L2 norm quality thresholds by dimension
# Lower values indicate better approximation quality
#
# These are exponential because higher dimensions naturally have larger errors
dim_2 = 1.0e-3
dim_3 = 1.0e-2
dim_4 = 1.0e-1
dim_5 = 5.0e-1
dim_6 = 1.0
default = 10.0  # Used for dimensions > 6

[parameter_recovery]
# Parameter recovery thresholds
#
# param_distance_threshold: Maximum distance to consider a parameter "recovered"
#   (as fraction of domain size or absolute distance)
param_distance_threshold = 0.01

# trajectory_distance_threshold: Maximum trajectory distance for recovery
trajectory_distance_threshold = 1.0e-3

[convergence]
# Convergence quality thresholds
#
# min_improvement_factor: Minimum improvement ratio between consecutive degrees
#   L2_new <= L2_old * min_improvement_factor
#   (1.0 = no improvement, 0.9 = 10% improvement required)
min_improvement_factor = 0.95

# stagnation_tolerance: Number of consecutive degrees without improvement
#   before warning about stagnation
stagnation_tolerance = 3

# absolute_improvement_threshold: Absolute improvement threshold
#   (ignore stagnation if L2 is already very small)
absolute_improvement_threshold = 1.0e-6

[objective_distribution]
# Objective value distribution quality
#
# outlier_iqr_multiplier: IQR multiplier for outlier detection
#   Values beyond Q1 - k*IQR or Q3 + k*IQR are considered outliers
outlier_iqr_multiplier = 3.0

# max_outlier_fraction: Maximum fraction of outliers before warning
max_outlier_fraction = 0.1

# min_points_for_distribution_check: Minimum critical points needed
#   to check distribution quality
min_points_for_distribution_check = 10

[numerical_stability]
# Numerical stability thresholds
#
# max_condition_number: Maximum acceptable condition number
max_condition_number = 1.0e12

# warn_condition_number: Condition number threshold for warnings
warn_condition_number = 1.0e8
