# Archive: Bug Fix Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from the development and testing of the landscape fidelity feature.

## Files

### LANDSCAPE_FIDELITY_TEST_PLAN.md
Comprehensive 10-phase test plan created during initial testing. Documents the systematic approach to validating the landscape fidelity implementation.

### LANDSCAPE_FIDELITY_TEST_RESULTS.md
Initial test results that discovered the two critical bugs (compilation error and global minima handling). This document led to the iterative fixes that resolved both issues.

## Context

These documents were part of the bug discovery and fixing process for commits:
- `bf8ed57` - Initial bug fixes (partial)
- `f3f73d6` - Final resolution with asymmetric criterion

Both bugs are now fully resolved. See `../VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` for the final status.
